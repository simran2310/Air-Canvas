# Air-Canvas
Air canvas is a webcam interactive white board, given the real time webcam data, this paint-like python application uses OpenCV library to track an object-of-interest (a bottle cap in this case) and allows the user to draw by moving the object, which makes it both awesome and challenging to draw simple things.
